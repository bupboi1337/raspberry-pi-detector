# Raspberry Pi Detector
Should run on any unix system.  
Detects if there is a raspberry pi on your local network!
This is licenced under gpl v3 btw
just run it in bash and it should tell you if there is a rpi on your local network.

# How do I run it
**You do need ping**
just run it in bash I guess
